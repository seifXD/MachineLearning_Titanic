# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
## Project Overview
This project is a part of the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “Did a passenger survive the Titanic sinking?” based on features such as age, gender, class, and more.

I approached this challenge as a way to further my data science skills, focusing particularly on feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Approach
The key steps in my workflow were:

### Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Feature encoding using pd.get_dummies
Feature scaling and transformation
Exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns related to survival.
### Modeling:

I used a Random Forest Classifier from the sklearn.ensemble package, fine-tuning hyperparameters such as n_estimators and max_depth to optimize the model's performance.
### Evaluation:

The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and other metrics. A confusion matrix and learning curves were also employed to visualize the model’s performance.

## Challenges & Solutions
Dealing with Missing Data: Many passengers had missing values for Age. I employed techniques such as filling missing values with the median or mean.

Feature Selection: Identifying which features contributed most to survival prediction was key. I used feature importance from the Random Forest model to prioritize significant features.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy score of X% on the test set. Below are some visualizations that helped in understanding the model performance:

## Future Improvements
Model Optimization: Further hyperparameter tuning could improve performance.
More Complex Models: Exploring other models like XGBoost or Neural Networks could provide a performance boost.
Feature Engineering: Further feature transformations or combining features might reveal better patterns for survival.
## Conclusion
This project served as a practical application of machine learning techniques in a real-world scenario. It allowed me to improve my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation while learning valuable lessons in how different features contribute to survival predictions on the Titanic dataset.
